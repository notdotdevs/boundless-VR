# 🛡️ Boundless VR

**Boundless VR** is an immersive Viking-pirate adventure set across a vast, mythic ocean. Blending Norse folklore with high-seas exploration, the game lets players command customizable longships, battle legendary creatures, raid hostile islands, and engage in physics-driven combat — all built for fully interactive VR.  
Currently in early development, Boundless VR focuses on fast-paced ship maneuvering, discovery, and cooperative adventure on an ever-expanding open sea.
